# MIT6.824 Distributed Systems

mit6.824 Spring 2020. Implemented with Go 1.13.

http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2020/schedule.html

MIT 6.824 is a graduate-level course offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) focusing on distributed systems. The course provides an in-depth exploration of the design, implementation, and evaluation of distributed systems.

In this repository, I realized a Raft-based KV store. I realized a Paxos-based KV store in another repository ([6.824-2015](https://github.com/coleanthony/6.824-2015)).
